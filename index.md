# instructAR -- Enhancing Teaching Experience with AR

**Derek Zhang and Chih-Yun Tseng**

Welcome to our Advances in XR (CMSC498F/CMSC838C) final project ***instructAR***.

## Project Description
**instructAR** (pronounced *"instructor"*) is an mobile app that facilitates classroom teaching experience for instructors. There are 3 features that we are proposing for the app:
1. **Sentiment dectection with our original ML model:** During the pandemic, many teachers are having a hard time learning how students are doing (e.g. confusion or frustration) in class due to mask mandates. Our first step is to implement a user friendly system for sentiment detection on unoccluded faces. We are hopeful but not yet sure if this can be extended to masked faces (that's research?).

2. **AR studentID:** When teachers want to get to know their students better, they can use our app to scan a student's ID card and a mini AR resume will pop out listing the key informations about a student.

3. **Speak-into-text memo:** Many times, teachers ask students to "Remind me after class" or "Remind me on Piazza" if a question arouses during lecture. However, this usually causes both parties to forget about the reminder. Our app aims to enable the speak-into-text feature for teachers to transcribe in-class announcements into text memos.
